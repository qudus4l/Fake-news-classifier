# Fake News Classifier

A machine learning project to classify news articles as either "real" or "fake".

## Description

This project is a supervised machine learning project that uses a dataset of labeled news articles to train a model to classify news articles as either "real" or "fake". The model uses natural language processing techniques to extract features from the text of the articles and applies a classification algorithm to predict the class of each article.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
The following Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
sklearn
nltk
matplotlib
seaborn
### Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Usage
To use the project, run the code cells in the jupyter notebook.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consists of approximately 44,000 news articles, half of which are labeled as "real" and half of which are labeled as "fake".

### Results

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 95% on the test set.
